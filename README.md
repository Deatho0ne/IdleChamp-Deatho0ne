### Idle Champion Scripts and stuff
## General Info
These are scripts to help you in Idle Champions. Scripts by Deatho0ne and others on https://discord.gg/idlechampions. Please do not bug the others mentioned for help with these scripts. Other discord members and I shall help you only in #scripting, if we feel inclined to do so. There is a good chance someone will help you, since we were most likely in your shoes at one point.

## Basic Scripts and other helpers
### GeneralLeveling.ahk
Should work no matter the favor you have: pushing, run variants, or do almost anything you want in the game without doing to much. Can edit it to make it click and even not level champs.

### BrivSkipCalc.ahk
Should give you a rough idea of stacks needed for your next run and roughly the time needed to get those stacks on a portal area before you reset. Need to edit to get your numbers.

### Settings
Should help getting Bootch's Script, Montrose's Script, and the included (modified Bootch's script, GemFarm.ahk and EventFarm.ahk to work).

## What this repository was really created for
GemFarm.ahk and EventFarm.ahk please understand something about AHK scripts (google is your friend), if you do not I will point you to other scripts on Discord. They both need about e20 favor to run, but should be able to get away with lower favor I am just not sure how much is needed for both. They just need to get to the spec choices by the area to end, if this does not happen there is at least a time out in GemFarm to restart.
These scripts should be relatively simple to make work for you. They are very much image based and need the images to do what they do for the most part.

### GemFarm.ahk
Is a script that tries to speed through Mad Wizard with the best champs allowed to me depending on patrons. It can pretty much be started for outside of adventures or inside and detects the patron that it should run. In all versions of Mad Wizard, not named Strahd, it uses Briv and is mostly designed around his speed up mechanic. Please read/edit the script if you want to use it and/or are lacking any of the champs.  Should not be to hard to figure out how to make it work for you as long as you get a few things about AHK.

### EventFarm.ahk
Is a script built off of GemFarm's images, but is built to run any event champ Free Play to area 51 and repeat. I do not use Briv in this, since it is way harder to build stacks on him at area 51 to 54 after picking his Spec. This script works mostly off of clicking a spot relative to one image to start an event FP. Please read/edit the script to get it do what you want.
Do not have a current Patron selected. You need to complete the oldest and second oldest champs variants, this is part of the reason for e20 favor, to run all event champs. Melf at roughly e10 favor will not be at spec by area 50, I do know this. If enough edits can get away with just click damage getting you past area 51, but not sure at all what this is.
